# Join Point Clouds
The `join-point-clouds` model uses [Point Cloud Library (PCL)](https://github.com/PointCloudLibrary/pcl) to combine the PCD outputs of depth cameras already registered in your config to create a joined point cloud output. It uses the [Viam builtin frame system](https://docs.viam.com/services/frame-system/), and optionally the [iterative closest points (ICP) algorithm](https://pointclouds.org/documentation/classpcl_1_1_iterative_closest_point.html), to align and combine the clouds within a single frame.

Note: combining PCDs with RGB data is currently unsupported.

Navigate to the **CONFIGURE** tab of your machine's page in [the Viam app](https://app.viam.com), searching for the modular component `join-point-clouds` and selecting the model `viam:join-camera:join-point-clouds`.

## Configure your `join-point-clouds` component

Copy and paste the following attributes into your JSON configuration:

```json
    {
        "source_cameras": [
          "pcd-cam-1",
          "pcd-cam-2"
        ],
        "target_frame": "world",
        "merge_method": "naive",
        "proximity_threshold_mm": 0.05
      },
      "frame": {
        "parent": "world",
        "translation": {
          "x": 0,
          "y": 0,
          "z": 0
        },
        "orientation": {
          "type": "quaternion",
          "value": {
            "x": 0,
            "y": 0,
            "z": 0,
            "w": 1
          }
        }
      }
```
Make sure to set up the `source_cameras` components [frame system](https://docs.viam.com/operate/mobility/define-geometry/) data accurately for best results.

### Attributes
The following attributes are available for the `join-point-clouds` component:

| Attribute | Type | Required? | Description |
| --------- | ---- | --------- | ----------- |
| `source_cameras` | []string | **Required** | The list of existing camera components in your machine to get input PCDs from |
| `target_frame` | string | **Required** | The target frame in the machine frame system to align the resultant PCD to |
| `merge_method`  | string | Optional | Either "naive" or "icp"â€” "icp" will use ICP to further align the PCDs and combine points below the proximity threshold. Naive will use only the frame system transformation with no further processing. |
| `proximity_threshold_mm`  | int | Optional | Only used when ICP is requested. ICP will combine points under this distance from each other. <br> Default: `0.05`. |
